1. Create an account on [Pixela](https://pixe.la/).
2. Generate a token for your Pixela account.
3. Create a graph on Pixela to track your running distance.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Sakib-Dalal/Running_Habit_Tracker.git
```

2. Open the `main.py` file and replace `<user_name>`, `<token>`, and `<graphID>` with your Pixela username, token, and graph ID respectively.

3. Run the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Enter the distance you ran when prompted.

5. Your running data will be logged to your Pixela graph.
